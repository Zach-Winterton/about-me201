            <p> Hello, my name is J. Matt Miguel, and I was born in Seattle, WA but also grew up in Oakland, CA. I have lived in Seattle since 2000 so both are home. I am currently a Pricing Analyst in the acquisitions team for Zillow Offers, an iBuying service for Zillow Group, as well as a software developer in training through Code Fellows.  </p>
